-	We have started making the basics for the game. That includes basic models, basic scripts, and other smaller stuff. By now the idea is solidified, but some basic things are still missing. We still need to make scripts, like killing the enemies, and a game over screen.

~~ - start screen 
- end screen
- victory screen
- stop spawner
- gun 
- xp
- mor enemy over time
- stronger enemy
- garlic
